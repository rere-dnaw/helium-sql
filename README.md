# helium-sql
This is app for pulling data from API and saving to light sql db.
The data is pulled from three different sources:
- binance
- https://alternative.me/crypto/api/
- https://docs.helium.com/api/blockchain/introduction

The app require `statics.py` file for working which is not included in the repository.

 `statics.py` 
```python
TOKEN_LIST = ['BTC/USDT','HNT/USDT']

DB_FILE_PATH ='dbHeliumApp' 

START_DAY = '2021-01-01 00:00:00'
  
BINANCE_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY'

BINANCE_SECRET_KEY='YOUR_KEY'
```

Also I created second repository for displaying data generated by **helium-sql** which can be found here. https://github.com/rere-dnaw/helium-app
